\description{
This object contains six chromatograms of the microbial
antagonism interaction. Microbials were cultured in carrot-maize-agar.
Inoculation was made from Petri dishes with the fully-grown fungal cells and
sterile distilled water (to wash the surface of the plate). The plate was 
scraped with a sterile glass handle to obtain the spore suspension.
The suspension was liquated and the concentration of 2.4 x 105 spores/mL was
determined using a Neubauer chamber and an optical microscope. Then, 50 uL
of the suspension was inoculated in a flow chamber into the tubes containing
the culture medium. Tubes were kept at 25 celsius degree in a growth
chamber with 12h of photoperiod. 

A solid-phase microextraction (SPME) assay containing a
DVB / CAR / PDMS (Divinylbenzene / Carboxene / Polymethylsiloxane 50/30 mm)
fiber was placed into the tube headspace.

A set of columns consisting of HP-5MS 30m x 0.25mm x 0.25 um
connected to a Supelcowax 1m x 0.10mm Ã— 0.10um 
with a 1m x 0.25mm deactivated silica capillary being allocated between
them. In these tests, a modulation period of 5s was used.

For GCxGC-QMS data acquisition, GCMSsolution version 5.3 software was used.
The temperature program were 60-165 celcius at 3 celcius/min;
165 celcius - 260celcius at 20 celcius/min; 260 celcius (5 min);
flow rate was 0.6 mL/min (Helium 5.0 carrier gas); splitless injection mode,
ion source temperature 200 celcius, interface temperature
260 celcius; voltage 0,9 kV; mass range 50-380 m/z; acquisition rate 25Hz and
electron ionization (70eV).
